# # Exercise 1:

# # Write a shell script that displays "This script will exit with a 0 exit status." 
# # Be sure that the script does indeed exit with a 0 exit status.

# echo "This script will exit with a 0 exit status."
# echo "$?"

# # Exercise 2:

# # Write a shell script that accepts a file or directory name as an argument. 
# # Have the script report if it is a regular file, a directory, or other type of file. 
# # If it is a regular file, exit with a 0 exit status. If it is a directory, exit with a 1 exit status. 
# # If it is some other type of file, exit with a 2 exit status.

# if [ -f $1 ]; then
#     echo "$1 is regualar file and will be exit as "0"."
#     exit 0
    
# elif [ -d $1 ]; then
#     echo "$1 is dir and will be exit as "1"."
#     exit 1

# else 
#     echo "$1 is other type and will be exit as "2"."
#     exit 2

# Exercise 3:

# Write a script that executes the command "cat /etc/shadow". 
# If the command returns a 0 exit status report "Command succeeded" and exit with a 0 exit status. 
# If the command returns a nonÂ­zero exit status report "Command failed" and exit with a 1 exit status.
