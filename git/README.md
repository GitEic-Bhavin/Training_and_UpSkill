11. `git revert <hash>`

- git revert creates a new commit that **undoes the changes made by a previous commit**.
- It does not delete history, unlike git reset --hard.
- Thatâ€™s why git revert is the safe way to undo a change in shared or remote repositories.

- **`Run` **git push** `after git revert`.

-git reset <commit-hash> moves HEAD to an older commit, removes later commits from history, but keeps the changes in your working directory (unstaged).

- After revert your commits, that given commit will be **unstage** and will asking for `git add`.

- **To continue with made changes of revert**, Run this

```bash
git revert --continue
```
