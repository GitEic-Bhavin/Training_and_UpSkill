# **Improved & Clear Explanation for Better English Communication**

When we communicate, our **first and most important goal** is to build a relationship with the other person.
If we fail to create a relaxed and comfortable connection, the rest of the conversation becomes harder.

So, in any conversation, our first task is to build **rapport**.


## **What is Rapport?**

- Rappo0rt is the feeling that the other person is “like us” — that we connect with them and feel comfortable.
- It happens when there is **similarity in communication style**.
Rapport is basically a pattern-matching process.

Interestingly, **most rapport-building happens without words**.

We build rapport through:

* Body orientation
* How we move
* Eye contact
* Facial expressions
* Tone of voice

Humans do this naturally — it’s instinctive.
However, stress, workplace pressure, or emotional tension can weaken these natural patterns.
A little **conscious effort** at the start of a conversation can greatly improve how it goes.



## **How We Build Rapport**

We build rapport through three kinds of behavior:

1. **Verbal behavior** – the words we use
2. **Vocal behavior** – tone, pitch, pace, volume
3. **Physical behavior** – body language, posture, expression

### **1. Verbal Behavior (Words)**

Words do matter.
For example:

* ❌ “That is sad.”
* ✅ “Oh, it’s disheartening to hear that. I’m sure it must be stressful for you.”

Both convey sympathy, but the second one shows **deeper empathy**.


### **2. Physical Behavior (Body Language)**

If words and body language do not match, people believe the **body**, not the words.

Example:

* If you greet someone with no smile and a cold expression but say,
  “It’s such a pleasure to see you,”
  they will believe your **face**, not your words.

So, to build rapport, show physical signs of being:

* Welcoming
* Relaxed
* Open


### **3. Vocal Behavior (Tone of Voice)**

Tone changes meaning.

Compare:

* “I’m really glad to see you.” (warm)
* “I’m really glad to see you.” (flat or irritated tone)

Pitch, pace, and volume matter:

* **Fast, loud, high-pitched →** you sound tense or nervous
* **Slow, soft, lower-pitched →** you sound calm and friendly

A warm tone builds rapport faster.

## **Small Talk Helps Build Rapport**

Starting a conversation with someone new can feel stressful or awkward.
“Breaking the ice” is a skill, and the key is to **reduce tension**.

How to start?

* Talk about something you both share in the moment
* Make a simple, friendly comment
* Ask a question that doesn’t feel personal or intrusive

Avoid:

* Talking too much about yourself
* Asking direct personal questions
  Both can increase tension.

Instead, make them feel comfortable.
When they relax, **you** will relax too.

Example at a networking event:

> “The event management seems really good this time, doesn’t it?”

This simple comment opens the door to a conversation.
What happens next depends on how you continue with engaging statements and supportive responses.


# **In Summary**

To improve communication and build rapport:

1. Match body language and tone naturally
2. Use empathetic and thoughtful words
3. Keep your tone warm and calm
4. Start conversations with simple, shared-situation comments
5. Focus on making the other person comfortable

When rapport is established early, conversations become smoother, easier, and more meaningful.


# how **small changes in words** can make your communication much more positive.
Two main ideas are explained:

# **1. Replace “BUT” with “AND” to sound more positive**

The word **“but”** usually cancels the first part of your sentence and makes it sound negative or limiting.

### **Example 1**

❌ *I'd love to go to Mauritius, **but** I'm scared of flying.*
→ Sounds like: “Because I’m scared, I can’t go.”

✔ *I'd love to go to Mauritius **and** I'm scared of flying.*
→ Sounds like: “I want to go AND I have a fear — a problem I can work on.”

This version shows:

* A desire (you want to go)
* A challenge (fear of flying)
* But NOT that the fear stops the desire


### **Example 2**

❌ *I understand your point, **but** I want to try another strategy.*
→ Makes the other person feel criticized.

✔ *I understand your point **and** I want to try another strategy.*
→ Shows you respect their idea and want to build on it.


### **Example 3**

❌ *I like your sales model, **but** we can use another strategy for faster growth.*
→ Feels like you don’t actually like their model.

✔ *I like your sales model **and** we can use another strategy for faster growth.*
→ Feels collaborative and supportive.


# **2. Use the word “YET” to stay positive about things you can’t do (for now)**

Adding **“yet”** at the end of a negative sentence changes the meaning from *hopeless* → *hopeful*.

### **Example 4**

❌ *I haven’t practiced enough to pass the math exam.*
✔ *I haven’t practiced enough to pass the math exam **yet**.*
→ Means: I will practice more; I can still improve.


### **Example 5**

❌ *I don’t know enough to pass the exam.*
✔ *I don’t know enough to pass the exam **yet**.*
→ Encourages learning and growth.


### **Example 6**

❌ *I don’t earn enough money to buy a house.*
✔ *I don’t earn enough money to buy a house **yet**.*
→ Suggests possibility and hope in the future.


# **Overall Message**

* **“But”** often sounds negative and shuts down ideas.
* **“And”** keeps the conversation open and positive.
* **“Yet”** turns a negative statement into a hopeful one.



# **Short & Easy Explanation**

- This passage explains an important communication rule:

### **People love talking about themselves — not about you.**

To be a good communicator, you must:

### ✔ Listen more

### ✔ Talk less about yourself

### ✔ Encourage others to share

If you do this, people will naturally like you and trust you.


# **Why this matters**

Most people want:

* Someone who listens
* Someone who understands
* Someone who cares

If you provide that, you instantly become someone they enjoy talking to.


# **How to do it correctly**

### 1. Encourage others to speak

Use phrases like:

* “Oh, tell me more!”
* “Wow, that’s interesting!”
* “Really? What happened next?”

These make people feel valued and open up further.


### 2. Don’t hijack the conversation

If someone is telling you their story or problem, **don’t switch to your own story**.

❌ Wrong:

> “I understand you’re stressed… the same happened to me last year when—”

✔ Right:

> “I’m listening… what happened after that?”

Remember:
**They came to talk about their issue, not yours.**


### 3. Resist the urge to talk about yourself

You might WANT to share your own experiences, but doing so shuts the conversation down.

Good communicators control this urge.


# **Main Message**

If you want to build strong connections:

👉 Let people talk about themselves
👉 Be genuinely interested
👉 Don’t make conversations about you

This instantly makes you a better communicator and a more likable person.


When to use **"I"** and When not to use **"You"**
---

## **What is “I-Talk”?**

**I-Talk** means expressing your feelings and concerns by starting with **“I”** instead of blaming the other person with **“You”**.

### Why it works:

* No one can argue with your **feelings**.
* You avoid **blame**, so the other person is less defensive.
* You focus on the **impact**, not the person’s character.
* It invites a **calm conversation** instead of a fight.

### Example:

❌ **Accusation (You-talk):**
“You never do the dishes. This house is always a mess because of you!”

✔️ **I-Talk (Better):**
“I feel stressed and disappointed when I come home and see that the dishes are undone after you promised to do them.”

This changes the tone completely.


## **Why is I-Talk powerful?**

Because:

* People may argue with your *interpretation*
  (“I didn’t do the dishes because I was busy!”)
* But they **cannot deny your feelings**
  (“You can’t feel disappointed!”)

It becomes about **your inner experience**, not their failure.


## **What is “We-Talk”?**

“We-Talk” replaces “I” with **“we”** when discussing shared actions, shared memories, or shared responsibilities.

### Why it works:

* Builds a sense of **teamwork**
* Shows **unity** and removes “me vs. you”
* Creates emotional closeness
* Makes the other person feel included and important

### Example:

❌ “I think the meeting starts at 3.”
(This sounds individual.)

✔️ “We need to be in the conference room by 3, right?”
(This sounds cooperative—same meaning, but more connected.)

Another:

❌ “I remember the summer of 2012. It was really hot.”
✔️ “We had a really hot summer in 2012.”
(Instantly feels like a shared memory.)


## **What exactly changes?**

The **words are small**, but the **impact is huge**.

### When you use **You-Talk**:

* The other person feels attacked
* They defend themselves
* The conversation becomes a fight

### When you use **I-Talk**:

* The other person understands how you feel
* They become less defensive
* They are more open to change

### When you use **We-Talk**:

* You create closeness
* You build teamwork
* You encourage cooperation


## Simple summary

* **I-Talk** = expressing *your* feelings → calm conversation
* **We-Talk** = highlighting *togetherness* → collaboration
* **You-Talk** = blame → arguments & defensiveness. 


Help but don't Patronize ( don't give your hand instead of fingur to help)
---


# **Why the 2nd approach is better (Offering help without sounding superior)**

When you genuinely want to help someone, **how you offer that help matters more than the help itself**.

Even if your intention is good, the wrong choice of words can make your friend feel:

* incapable
* judged
* pitied
* inferior

People never want to feel like they are receiving charity.


# **Example 1: Helping with a messy house**

### ❌ Option 1 (Insensitive, even if well-intentioned)**

“Do you need help with this place?”

This sounds:

* blunt
* judgmental
* like you’re pointing out their failure
* as if *they’re struggling and you’re rescuing them*

Your friend might feel ashamed or exposed.


### ✔️ Option 2 (Sensitive and thoughtful)**

“Hey, I've noticed you've been really tired and occupied lately.
This house is a pretty massive project.
I'd love to help you.
Can I come over this week and lend a hand?”

This sounds better because:

* You show **empathy** (“you’ve been tired and busy”)
* You understand the **context** (“this place is a big project”)
* You offer help as a **gesture of care**, not charity
* You treat them as an equal, not someone helpless

Here, the help feels like **support**, not **superiority**.


# **The deeper reason it works**

People accept help more easily when:

* they feel **understood**
* they feel **respected**
* they feel the help is **genuine**, not an obligation

Words shape emotions.
Even with good intentions, the wrong words can hurt.


# **Example 2: Lending clothes to a friend**

Your friend says she doesn’t have the right clothes for a clubbing night.

### ❌ Insensitive version:

“Hey no worries, you can wear this. I anyway don’t wear it often.”

This is problematic because it implies:

* the dress is old or rejected
* you don’t like it
* you don’t care about it
* so you don’t mind giving it away

It makes your friend feel she is getting something **inferior**.


### ✔️ Sensitive version:

“Hey, don’t worry, you can borrow mine.”

This feels:

* friendly
* respectful
* equal
* sincere

You’re saying:
“I want to help you, and I value you enough to offer something good.”


# **Overall lesson**

Helping is not only about doing something for others.
It is also about how you **communicate your intention**.


Say Thank you is All you Need
---


- While anybody helped to you. Generally people say like, `"Thank you so much!"`.
- And this can forgotable bcz this is not such impactfull or not genually.

- Instead of you can say,

* “Thank you for taking the time to make those notes for me. I really appreciate it.”
* “Thank you for standing in for me and gathering that information.”
* “Thank you for taking such detailed notes — that was genuinely helpful.”

These phrases are:
✔️ Personal
✔️ Specific
✔️ Heartfelt

They tell the person *why* you appreciated their help.
This makes them feel respected, valued, and deeply appreciated.


Behaviour over Character
---


## **Concept: Correct the Behavior, Not the Person**

When someone is not doing their work — for example, spending too much time on social media or coming late — the natural reaction is to label them:

* “You are lazy.”
* “You don’t care about your work.”
* “You are irresponsible.”

But the moment you attack their **personality**, they become **defensive**.
Instead of listening, they start thinking of excuses.

To avoid this, focus only on:

### ✔ **Facts**

### ✔ **Observable actions**

### ✔ **Consequences of those actions**

Not on their **character**.

This makes the person realize the issue without feeling insulted, and they become more cooperative.


## **How to Correct Behavior Without Blaming Personality**

### **1. Talk about the facts**

Mention what actually happened — the specific behavior.

### **2. Explain why the behavior is a problem**

Connect it to project deadlines, team impact, or expectations.

### **3. State the consequences or expectations**

Tell them what needs to change going forward.

This reduces defensiveness and increases accountability.


## **Example: Employee wasting time on social media**

❌ **Don’t say:**
“You’re lazy and wasting time. Stop using social media!”

✔ **Say instead:**
“Hey, I wanted to discuss something.
I noticed that in the past few days, you’ve spent around **2–3 hours during work hours** on social media.
The project that was supposed to be completed on Monday is still pending.
Since this project is high priority, we need your complete focus on it.
Let’s try to keep personal browsing outside work hours so we can finish this on time.”

Here you are:

* stating **facts**
* showing **impact**
* requesting a **change**
* not attacking the person

This makes them realize the issue without feeling judged.


## **Example: Employee coming late**

❌ **Don’t say:**
“You don’t care about your job. You’re irresponsible.”

✔ **Say:**
“You have come late **six times in the last two weeks**.
As you know, our team depends on everyone being available on time so work starts smoothly.
If this continues, we may need to take formal action.
Please ensure you arrive on time moving forward.”

Again:

* Behavior → mentioned
* Impact → explained
* Consequence → stated
* Personality attack → avoided


## **Managerial Ground Rules**

When correcting someone:

### ✔ Keep the message clear

### ✔ Keep it simple

### ✔ Be polite, not arrogant

### ✔ Be direct, not hesitant

### ✔ Talk about actions, not personality



Understand when no one wants your Advise
---

- When someone comes to you to share a problem or talk about a situation, remember that they may not be looking for suggestions or advice. Often, they simply want to be heard.

# **1. People may not be seeking advice — they just want to be heard**

**Example:**
Your friend says, *“Work has been so stressful lately. My manager keeps changing deadlines.”*
Instead of giving advice immediately like *“You should talk to HR,”*
you respond:
**“That sounds difficult. Tell me more—what happened?”**
They feel heard, not instructed.


# **2. Give advice only when asked**

**Example:**
Your colleague says, *“I don’t know what to do with my project issue.”*
You ask,
**“Would you like my suggestion, or do you just want to vent?”**
If they say, “I just want to vent,” you listen without giving advice.


# **3. Unsolicited advice can be annoying**

**Example:**
A friend shares: *“I am planning to start a diet next week.”*
You immediately say: *“You should join my diet plan, and stop eating carbs completely.”*
They didn’t ask for advice and may get irritated or stop sharing with you.


# **4. Do not go where you are not wanted**

**Example:**
Someone is discussing their relationship problems with another friend.
You jump in with:
*“You know what you should do? Leave him!”*
You were not part of the conversation—this feels intrusive and disrespectful.


# **5. Timing matters in giving advice**

**Example:**
Your teammate made a mistake in a meeting.
You could correct them publicly, but instead, you wait until you both are alone and say,
**“Hey, small thing—next time we present, maybe we can double-check that data together.”**
Your timing protects their confidence.


# **6. Give feedback privately when needed**

**Example:**
A coworker mispronounces a word during a presentation.
Do **not** correct them in front of 20 people.
Tell them later, privately:
**“Just for future presentations, that word is pronounced like this.”**


# **7. Be gentle when giving advice**

**Example:**
Friend: *“I’m thinking of changing my job.”*
Bad response: *“You’re always confused. You never stick to anything.”*
Gentle response:
**“If changing the job makes you happier, maybe it’s worth exploring. What are you thinking?”**


# **8. Do not make fun of things important to others**

**Example:**
Someone is excited about a small award they received.
You say: *“That’s nothing. Anyone can get that.”*
They feel hurt.
Proper behavior: Acknowledge their happiness.


# **9. Do not belittle or undermine feelings**

**Example:**
Friend: *“I’m feeling overwhelmed lately.”*
Wrong: *“Come on, it’s not a big deal. You’re overreacting.”*
Right:
**“I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. Want to talk about what’s overwhelming you?”**


# **10. Be clear and concise when speaking**

**Example:**
Instead of rambling:
*“So, like, yesterday I was thinking maybe, possibly if you can, you know…”*
Say clearly:
**“Can we submit the report by 4 PM?”**


# **11. Don’t speak without knowing the full facts**

**Example:**
You hear someone say, *“Varun missed the deadline again.”*
Without checking, you say,
*“He’s always careless!”*
Later you learn his mother was hospitalized.
Better approach:
**Ask first:** “What happened? Is everything okay?”


# **12. Don’t pass judgments quickly**

**Example:**
You see a coworker quiet and assume they are rude.
Later you learn they are dealing with personal issues.
Instead of judging, you could have asked:
**“You seem a bit quiet today—hope everything is okay?”**


# **13. Show interest in the conversation**

**Example:**
When someone is telling you something important,
keep your phone aside
maintain eye contact
and respond with small acknowledgments like **“I see,” “Okay,” “I understand.”**


# **14. Never talk with your mouth full**

**Example:**
During lunch, a friend asks: *“How was your weekend?”*
If you answer with food in your mouth, it looks rude.
Better:
Finish chewing → swallow → then respond.


If you want, I can also create a **single combined version**, a **short summary**, or a **presentation-style format**.



UnImpressive Verbal Fillers
---

# **1. Verbal fillers make your communication weak**

Words like **“um,” “uh,” “like,” “you know,” “basically,” “actually,” “so yeah…”**
are called **verbal fillers**.

Using them **occasionally** is fine.
But using them **repeatedly** makes you sound unsure, nervous, or unprepared.

### **Real Example:**

❌ *“So… um… I want to like… talk about… you know… our project updates.”*
This sounds unsure and unprofessional.

✔️ *“I want to talk about our project updates.”*
Clear and confident.


# **2. Check your own speaking habits**

Record yourself while speaking.
Then listen and count how many fillers you use.

### **Real Example:**

You listen to a 2-minute audio and notice
you said “um” **9 times** and “like” **5 times**.
That means you rely too much on fillers.


# **3. The best way to reduce fillers: Clarity of thought**

Fillers appear when your brain is confused or searching for the next word.
If you know what you want to say, you won’t need fillers.

### **Real Example:**

Before speaking → think:
**“What is my point?”**

Once your thought becomes clear, your speech becomes clear.


# **4. Use shorter sentences**

Short sentences = fewer fillers + easy to understand.

### **Bad Example (Long and complicated):**

“Hello everyone, I’m here to talk about the role of technology, which of course we are surrounded with in education, paving way for some great career opportunities that our students can explore.”

This is long, heavy, and confusing.

### **Good Example (Short & clear):**

“Hello, everyone.
I’m here to talk about the role of technology in education.
We are surrounded by it.
It is creating great career opportunities for our students.”

Much clearer.
Much easier to listen to.


# **5. Use simple words unless technical terms are needed**

Simple words help people understand faster.

### **Real Example:**

Instead of: *“Utilize”*
Say: *“Use.”*

Instead of: *“Commence”*
Say: *“Start.”*

Instead of long sentences you can’t say in one breath, keep them short and clean.


# **6. A practical exercise to stop using fillers**

Write words like **“um,” “like,” “you know”** on a piece of paper
and stick it on your wall, door, or work desk—somewhere you see every day.

Whenever you speak and accidentally use one of those words,
your mind will recall the paper and remind you to avoid it.

This helps break the habit.


# **7. Fillers appear due to lack of clarity or discomfort**

When thoughts are messy, fillers pop out.

### **Real Example:**

You are presenting and forget your next point.
You start saying:
*“Ummm… so… I think… um…”*

Instead, you can pause.


# **8. Pausing is better than fillers**

A pause is powerful.
It sounds confident and gives your brain time to think.

### **Example:**

Instead of:
*“Um… next point is…”*
Say:
*“… Next point is…”*

Just a short silence.
No panic.
No fillers.


# **9. Do not force fancy vocabulary**

If big words don’t come naturally, don’t force them.
It will break your flow and increase fillers.

### **Bad Example:**

“I want to, um, elucidate the… um… primary objective…”

### **Good Example:**

“I want to explain the main objective.”

Simple and smooth.


# **10. Verbal tics appear when trying to recall something**

When memory is slow, fillers appear.

### **Practical Solution:**

If you are speaking to many people…
use **cue cards** —small cards with short points written on them.

This reduces pressure and prevents verbal fillers.



Guide you voice
---

- The best way to improve how you speak is to **listen to your own voice**.

- When we talk to people, we cannot hear ourselves properly.
So the solution is: **record your voice** and listen to it later.

- When you listen to the recording, you will understand:

* how you actually sound to others
* what is good
* what needs improvement

Then you can check:

* Is your voice too high or too low?
* Is your energy dull or too much?
* Are you speaking too fast or too slow?
* Do you sound confident or weak?
* Is your tone flat (monotonous) or does it have good variation?

- These things help you know what to fix.

- Sometimes, we think something is wrong with our voice, but actually no one else notices it.
So it’s helpful to ask **other people for feedback** too.
- They might notice something you missed, or tell you that you are overthinking.

- When you record your voice, don’t read from a book.
- That sounds fake and unnatural.

- Instead, record a **normal conversation** with friends or colleagues (with their permission).
- This will show your real style — your pauses, tone, pace, etc.

- Then listen to it and note:

* volume
* pitch
* tone
* energy

- Make small changes slowly.
- It will not improve in one day, but with practice you will sound better and more confident.

- Every habit takes time to build.
- But if you keep correcting yourself and practicing, your speaking style will improve and any issues you had will slowly disappear.
