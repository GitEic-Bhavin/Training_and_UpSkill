# **Improved & Clear Explanation for Better English Communication**

When we communicate, our **first and most important goal** is to build a relationship with the other person.
If we fail to create a relaxed and comfortable connection, the rest of the conversation becomes harder.

So, in any conversation, our first task is to build **rapport**.


## **What is Rapport?**

- Rappo0rt is the feeling that the other person is “like us” — that we connect with them and feel comfortable.
- It happens when there is **similarity in communication style**.
Rapport is basically a pattern-matching process.

Interestingly, **most rapport-building happens without words**.

We build rapport through:

* Body orientation
* How we move
* Eye contact
* Facial expressions
* Tone of voice

Humans do this naturally — it’s instinctive.
However, stress, workplace pressure, or emotional tension can weaken these natural patterns.
A little **conscious effort** at the start of a conversation can greatly improve how it goes.



## **How We Build Rapport**

We build rapport through three kinds of behavior:

1. **Verbal behavior** – the words we use
2. **Vocal behavior** – tone, pitch, pace, volume
3. **Physical behavior** – body language, posture, expression

### **1. Verbal Behavior (Words)**

Words do matter.
For example:

* ❌ “That is sad.”
* ✅ “Oh, it’s disheartening to hear that. I’m sure it must be stressful for you.”

Both convey sympathy, but the second one shows **deeper empathy**.


### **2. Physical Behavior (Body Language)**

If words and body language do not match, people believe the **body**, not the words.

Example:

* If you greet someone with no smile and a cold expression but say,
  “It’s such a pleasure to see you,”
  they will believe your **face**, not your words.

So, to build rapport, show physical signs of being:

* Welcoming
* Relaxed
* Open


### **3. Vocal Behavior (Tone of Voice)**

Tone changes meaning.

Compare:

* “I’m really glad to see you.” (warm)
* “I’m really glad to see you.” (flat or irritated tone)

Pitch, pace, and volume matter:

* **Fast, loud, high-pitched →** you sound tense or nervous
* **Slow, soft, lower-pitched →** you sound calm and friendly

A warm tone builds rapport faster.

## **Small Talk Helps Build Rapport**

Starting a conversation with someone new can feel stressful or awkward.
“Breaking the ice” is a skill, and the key is to **reduce tension**.

How to start?

* Talk about something you both share in the moment
* Make a simple, friendly comment
* Ask a question that doesn’t feel personal or intrusive

Avoid:

* Talking too much about yourself
* Asking direct personal questions
  Both can increase tension.

Instead, make them feel comfortable.
When they relax, **you** will relax too.

Example at a networking event:

> “The event management seems really good this time, doesn’t it?”

This simple comment opens the door to a conversation.
What happens next depends on how you continue with engaging statements and supportive responses.


# **In Summary**

To improve communication and build rapport:

1. Match body language and tone naturally
2. Use empathetic and thoughtful words
3. Keep your tone warm and calm
4. Start conversations with simple, shared-situation comments
5. Focus on making the other person comfortable

When rapport is established early, conversations become smoother, easier, and more meaningful.


# how **small changes in words** can make your communication much more positive.
Two main ideas are explained:

# **1. Replace “BUT” with “AND” to sound more positive**

The word **“but”** usually cancels the first part of your sentence and makes it sound negative or limiting.

### **Example 1**

❌ *I'd love to go to Mauritius, **but** I'm scared of flying.*
→ Sounds like: “Because I’m scared, I can’t go.”

✔ *I'd love to go to Mauritius **and** I'm scared of flying.*
→ Sounds like: “I want to go AND I have a fear — a problem I can work on.”

This version shows:

* A desire (you want to go)
* A challenge (fear of flying)
* But NOT that the fear stops the desire


### **Example 2**

❌ *I understand your point, **but** I want to try another strategy.*
→ Makes the other person feel criticized.

✔ *I understand your point **and** I want to try another strategy.*
→ Shows you respect their idea and want to build on it.


### **Example 3**

❌ *I like your sales model, **but** we can use another strategy for faster growth.*
→ Feels like you don’t actually like their model.

✔ *I like your sales model **and** we can use another strategy for faster growth.*
→ Feels collaborative and supportive.


# **2. Use the word “YET” to stay positive about things you can’t do (for now)**

Adding **“yet”** at the end of a negative sentence changes the meaning from *hopeless* → *hopeful*.

### **Example 4**

❌ *I haven’t practiced enough to pass the math exam.*
✔ *I haven’t practiced enough to pass the math exam **yet**.*
→ Means: I will practice more; I can still improve.


### **Example 5**

❌ *I don’t know enough to pass the exam.*
✔ *I don’t know enough to pass the exam **yet**.*
→ Encourages learning and growth.


### **Example 6**

❌ *I don’t earn enough money to buy a house.*
✔ *I don’t earn enough money to buy a house **yet**.*
→ Suggests possibility and hope in the future.


# **Overall Message**

* **“But”** often sounds negative and shuts down ideas.
* **“And”** keeps the conversation open and positive.
* **“Yet”** turns a negative statement into a hopeful one.



# **Short & Easy Explanation**

- This passage explains an important communication rule:

### **People love talking about themselves — not about you.**

To be a good communicator, you must:

### ✔ Listen more

### ✔ Talk less about yourself

### ✔ Encourage others to share

If you do this, people will naturally like you and trust you.


# **Why this matters**

Most people want:

* Someone who listens
* Someone who understands
* Someone who cares

If you provide that, you instantly become someone they enjoy talking to.


# **How to do it correctly**

### 1. Encourage others to speak

Use phrases like:

* “Oh, tell me more!”
* “Wow, that’s interesting!”
* “Really? What happened next?”

These make people feel valued and open up further.


### 2. Don’t hijack the conversation

If someone is telling you their story or problem, **don’t switch to your own story**.

❌ Wrong:

> “I understand you’re stressed… the same happened to me last year when—”

✔ Right:

> “I’m listening… what happened after that?”

Remember:
**They came to talk about their issue, not yours.**


### 3. Resist the urge to talk about yourself

You might WANT to share your own experiences, but doing so shuts the conversation down.

Good communicators control this urge.


# **Main Message**

If you want to build strong connections:

👉 Let people talk about themselves
👉 Be genuinely interested
👉 Don’t make conversations about you

This instantly makes you a better communicator and a more likable person.


When to use **"I"** and When not to use **"You"**
---

## **What is “I-Talk”?**

**I-Talk** means expressing your feelings and concerns by starting with **“I”** instead of blaming the other person with **“You”**.

### Why it works:

* No one can argue with your **feelings**.
* You avoid **blame**, so the other person is less defensive.
* You focus on the **impact**, not the person’s character.
* It invites a **calm conversation** instead of a fight.

### Example:

❌ **Accusation (You-talk):**
“You never do the dishes. This house is always a mess because of you!”

✔️ **I-Talk (Better):**
“I feel stressed and disappointed when I come home and see that the dishes are undone after you promised to do them.”

This changes the tone completely.


## **Why is I-Talk powerful?**

Because:

* People may argue with your *interpretation*
  (“I didn’t do the dishes because I was busy!”)
* But they **cannot deny your feelings**
  (“You can’t feel disappointed!”)

It becomes about **your inner experience**, not their failure.


## **What is “We-Talk”?**

“We-Talk” replaces “I” with **“we”** when discussing shared actions, shared memories, or shared responsibilities.

### Why it works:

* Builds a sense of **teamwork**
* Shows **unity** and removes “me vs. you”
* Creates emotional closeness
* Makes the other person feel included and important

### Example:

❌ “I think the meeting starts at 3.”
(This sounds individual.)

✔️ “We need to be in the conference room by 3, right?”
(This sounds cooperative—same meaning, but more connected.)

Another:

❌ “I remember the summer of 2012. It was really hot.”
✔️ “We had a really hot summer in 2012.”
(Instantly feels like a shared memory.)


## **What exactly changes?**

The **words are small**, but the **impact is huge**.

### When you use **You-Talk**:

* The other person feels attacked
* They defend themselves
* The conversation becomes a fight

### When you use **I-Talk**:

* The other person understands how you feel
* They become less defensive
* They are more open to change

### When you use **We-Talk**:

* You create closeness
* You build teamwork
* You encourage cooperation


## Simple summary

* **I-Talk** = expressing *your* feelings → calm conversation
* **We-Talk** = highlighting *togetherness* → collaboration
* **You-Talk** = blame → arguments & defensiveness. 


Help but don't Patronize ( don't give your hand instead of fingur to help)
---


# **Why the 2nd approach is better (Offering help without sounding superior)**

When you genuinely want to help someone, **how you offer that help matters more than the help itself**.

Even if your intention is good, the wrong choice of words can make your friend feel:

* incapable
* judged
* pitied
* inferior

People never want to feel like they are receiving charity.


# **Example 1: Helping with a messy house**

### ❌ Option 1 (Insensitive, even if well-intentioned)**

“Do you need help with this place?”

This sounds:

* blunt
* judgmental
* like you’re pointing out their failure
* as if *they’re struggling and you’re rescuing them*

Your friend might feel ashamed or exposed.


### ✔️ Option 2 (Sensitive and thoughtful)**

“Hey, I've noticed you've been really tired and occupied lately.
This house is a pretty massive project.
I'd love to help you.
Can I come over this week and lend a hand?”

This sounds better because:

* You show **empathy** (“you’ve been tired and busy”)
* You understand the **context** (“this place is a big project”)
* You offer help as a **gesture of care**, not charity
* You treat them as an equal, not someone helpless

Here, the help feels like **support**, not **superiority**.


# **The deeper reason it works**

People accept help more easily when:

* they feel **understood**
* they feel **respected**
* they feel the help is **genuine**, not an obligation

Words shape emotions.
Even with good intentions, the wrong words can hurt.


# **Example 2: Lending clothes to a friend**

Your friend says she doesn’t have the right clothes for a clubbing night.

### ❌ Insensitive version:

“Hey no worries, you can wear this. I anyway don’t wear it often.”

This is problematic because it implies:

* the dress is old or rejected
* you don’t like it
* you don’t care about it
* so you don’t mind giving it away

It makes your friend feel she is getting something **inferior**.


### ✔️ Sensitive version:

“Hey, don’t worry, you can borrow mine.”

This feels:

* friendly
* respectful
* equal
* sincere

You’re saying:
“I want to help you, and I value you enough to offer something good.”


# **Overall lesson**

Helping is not only about doing something for others.
It is also about how you **communicate your intention**.


Say Thank you is All you Need
---


- While anybody helped to you. Generally people say like, `"Thank you so much!"`.
- And this can forgotable bcz this is not such impactfull or not genually.

- Instead of you can say,

* “Thank you for taking the time to make those notes for me. I really appreciate it.”
* “Thank you for standing in for me and gathering that information.”
* “Thank you for taking such detailed notes — that was genuinely helpful.”

These phrases are:
✔️ Personal
✔️ Specific
✔️ Heartfelt

They tell the person *why* you appreciated their help.
This makes them feel respected, valued, and deeply appreciated.


Behaviour over Character
---


## **Concept: Correct the Behavior, Not the Person**

When someone is not doing their work — for example, spending too much time on social media or coming late — the natural reaction is to label them:

* “You are lazy.”
* “You don’t care about your work.”
* “You are irresponsible.”

But the moment you attack their **personality**, they become **defensive**.
Instead of listening, they start thinking of excuses.

To avoid this, focus only on:

### ✔ **Facts**

### ✔ **Observable actions**

### ✔ **Consequences of those actions**

Not on their **character**.

This makes the person realize the issue without feeling insulted, and they become more cooperative.


## **How to Correct Behavior Without Blaming Personality**

### **1. Talk about the facts**

Mention what actually happened — the specific behavior.

### **2. Explain why the behavior is a problem**

Connect it to project deadlines, team impact, or expectations.

### **3. State the consequences or expectations**

Tell them what needs to change going forward.

This reduces defensiveness and increases accountability.


## **Example: Employee wasting time on social media**

❌ **Don’t say:**
“You’re lazy and wasting time. Stop using social media!”

✔ **Say instead:**
“Hey, I wanted to discuss something.
I noticed that in the past few days, you’ve spent around **2–3 hours during work hours** on social media.
The project that was supposed to be completed on Monday is still pending.
Since this project is high priority, we need your complete focus on it.
Let’s try to keep personal browsing outside work hours so we can finish this on time.”

Here you are:

* stating **facts**
* showing **impact**
* requesting a **change**
* not attacking the person

This makes them realize the issue without feeling judged.


## **Example: Employee coming late**

❌ **Don’t say:**
“You don’t care about your job. You’re irresponsible.”

✔ **Say:**
“You have come late **six times in the last two weeks**.
As you know, our team depends on everyone being available on time so work starts smoothly.
If this continues, we may need to take formal action.
Please ensure you arrive on time moving forward.”

Again:

* Behavior → mentioned
* Impact → explained
* Consequence → stated
* Personality attack → avoided


## **Managerial Ground Rules**

When correcting someone:

### ✔ Keep the message clear

### ✔ Keep it simple

### ✔ Be polite, not arrogant

### ✔ Be direct, not hesitant

### ✔ Talk about actions, not personality



Understand when no one wants your Advise
---

- When someone comes to you to share a problem or talk about a situation, remember that they may not be looking for suggestions or advice. Often, they simply want to be heard.

# **1. People may not be seeking advice — they just want to be heard**

**Example:**
Your friend says, *“Work has been so stressful lately. My manager keeps changing deadlines.”*
Instead of giving advice immediately like *“You should talk to HR,”*
you respond:
**“That sounds difficult. Tell me more—what happened?”**
They feel heard, not instructed.


# **2. Give advice only when asked**

**Example:**
Your colleague says, *“I don’t know what to do with my project issue.”*
You ask,
**“Would you like my suggestion, or do you just want to vent?”**
If they say, “I just want to vent,” you listen without giving advice.


# **3. Unsolicited advice can be annoying**

**Example:**
A friend shares: *“I am planning to start a diet next week.”*
You immediately say: *“You should join my diet plan, and stop eating carbs completely.”*
They didn’t ask for advice and may get irritated or stop sharing with you.


# **4. Do not go where you are not wanted**

**Example:**
Someone is discussing their relationship problems with another friend.
You jump in with:
*“You know what you should do? Leave him!”*
You were not part of the conversation—this feels intrusive and disrespectful.


# **5. Timing matters in giving advice**

**Example:**
Your teammate made a mistake in a meeting.
You could correct them publicly, but instead, you wait until you both are alone and say,
**“Hey, small thing—next time we present, maybe we can double-check that data together.”**
Your timing protects their confidence.


# **6. Give feedback privately when needed**

**Example:**
A coworker mispronounces a word during a presentation.
Do **not** correct them in front of 20 people.
Tell them later, privately:
**“Just for future presentations, that word is pronounced like this.”**


# **7. Be gentle when giving advice**

**Example:**
Friend: *“I’m thinking of changing my job.”*
Bad response: *“You’re always confused. You never stick to anything.”*
Gentle response:
**“If changing the job makes you happier, maybe it’s worth exploring. What are you thinking?”**


# **8. Do not make fun of things important to others**

**Example:**
Someone is excited about a small award they received.
You say: *“That’s nothing. Anyone can get that.”*
They feel hurt.
Proper behavior: Acknowledge their happiness.


# **9. Do not belittle or undermine feelings**

**Example:**
Friend: *“I’m feeling overwhelmed lately.”*
Wrong: *“Come on, it’s not a big deal. You’re overreacting.”*
Right:
**“I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. Want to talk about what’s overwhelming you?”**


# **10. Be clear and concise when speaking**

**Example:**
Instead of rambling:
*“So, like, yesterday I was thinking maybe, possibly if you can, you know…”*
Say clearly:
**“Can we submit the report by 4 PM?”**


# **11. Don’t speak without knowing the full facts**

**Example:**
You hear someone say, *“Varun missed the deadline again.”*
Without checking, you say,
*“He’s always careless!”*
Later you learn his mother was hospitalized.
Better approach:
**Ask first:** “What happened? Is everything okay?”


# **12. Don’t pass judgments quickly**

**Example:**
You see a coworker quiet and assume they are rude.
Later you learn they are dealing with personal issues.
Instead of judging, you could have asked:
**“You seem a bit quiet today—hope everything is okay?”**


# **13. Show interest in the conversation**

**Example:**
When someone is telling you something important,
keep your phone aside
maintain eye contact
and respond with small acknowledgments like **“I see,” “Okay,” “I understand.”**


# **14. Never talk with your mouth full**

**Example:**
During lunch, a friend asks: *“How was your weekend?”*
If you answer with food in your mouth, it looks rude.
Better:
Finish chewing → swallow → then respond.


If you want, I can also create a **single combined version**, a **short summary**, or a **presentation-style format**.



UnImpressive Verbal Fillers
---

# **1. Verbal fillers make your communication weak**

Words like **“um,” “uh,” “like,” “you know,” “basically,” “actually,” “so yeah…”**
are called **verbal fillers**.

Using them **occasionally** is fine.
But using them **repeatedly** makes you sound unsure, nervous, or unprepared.

### **Real Example:**

❌ *“So… um… I want to like… talk about… you know… our project updates.”*
This sounds unsure and unprofessional.

✔️ *“I want to talk about our project updates.”*
Clear and confident.


# **2. Check your own speaking habits**

Record yourself while speaking.
Then listen and count how many fillers you use.

### **Real Example:**

You listen to a 2-minute audio and notice
you said “um” **9 times** and “like” **5 times**.
That means you rely too much on fillers.


# **3. The best way to reduce fillers: Clarity of thought**

Fillers appear when your brain is confused or searching for the next word.
If you know what you want to say, you won’t need fillers.

### **Real Example:**

Before speaking → think:
**“What is my point?”**

Once your thought becomes clear, your speech becomes clear.


# **4. Use shorter sentences**

Short sentences = fewer fillers + easy to understand.

### **Bad Example (Long and complicated):**

“Hello everyone, I’m here to talk about the role of technology, which of course we are surrounded with in education, paving way for some great career opportunities that our students can explore.”

This is long, heavy, and confusing.

### **Good Example (Short & clear):**

“Hello, everyone.
I’m here to talk about the role of technology in education.
We are surrounded by it.
It is creating great career opportunities for our students.”

Much clearer.
Much easier to listen to.


# **5. Use simple words unless technical terms are needed**

Simple words help people understand faster.

### **Real Example:**

Instead of: *“Utilize”*
Say: *“Use.”*

Instead of: *“Commence”*
Say: *“Start.”*

Instead of long sentences you can’t say in one breath, keep them short and clean.


# **6. A practical exercise to stop using fillers**

Write words like **“um,” “like,” “you know”** on a piece of paper
and stick it on your wall, door, or work desk—somewhere you see every day.

Whenever you speak and accidentally use one of those words,
your mind will recall the paper and remind you to avoid it.

This helps break the habit.


# **7. Fillers appear due to lack of clarity or discomfort**

When thoughts are messy, fillers pop out.

### **Real Example:**

You are presenting and forget your next point.
You start saying:
*“Ummm… so… I think… um…”*

Instead, you can pause.


# **8. Pausing is better than fillers**

A pause is powerful.
It sounds confident and gives your brain time to think.

### **Example:**

Instead of:
*“Um… next point is…”*
Say:
*“… Next point is…”*

Just a short silence.
No panic.
No fillers.


# **9. Do not force fancy vocabulary**

If big words don’t come naturally, don’t force them.
It will break your flow and increase fillers.

### **Bad Example:**

“I want to, um, elucidate the… um… primary objective…”

### **Good Example:**

“I want to explain the main objective.”

Simple and smooth.


# **10. Verbal tics appear when trying to recall something**

When memory is slow, fillers appear.

### **Practical Solution:**

If you are speaking to many people…
use **cue cards** —small cards with short points written on them.

This reduces pressure and prevents verbal fillers.



Guide you voice
---

- The best way to improve how you speak is to **listen to your own voice**.

- When we talk to people, we cannot hear ourselves properly.
So the solution is: **record your voice** and listen to it later.

- When you listen to the recording, you will understand:

* how you actually sound to others
* what is good
* what needs improvement

Then you can check:

* Is your voice too high or too low?
* Is your energy dull or too much?
* Are you speaking too fast or too slow?
* Do you sound confident or weak?
* Is your tone flat (monotonous) or does it have good variation?

- These things help you know what to fix.

- Sometimes, we think something is wrong with our voice, but actually no one else notices it.
So it’s helpful to ask **other people for feedback** too.
- They might notice something you missed, or tell you that you are overthinking.

- When you record your voice, don’t read from a book.
- That sounds fake and unnatural.

- Instead, record a **normal conversation** with friends or colleagues (with their permission).
- This will show your real style — your pauses, tone, pace, etc.

- Then listen to it and note:

* volume
* pitch
* tone
* energy

- Make small changes slowly.
- It will not improve in one day, but with practice you will sound better and more confident.

- Every habit takes time to build.
- But if you keep correcting yourself and practicing, your speaking style will improve and any issues you had will slowly disappear.

Grab the Attentions
---


## **What this passage is teaching you**

It explains **how to start and structure a talk or presentation** so that you capture your audience’s attention and keep them engaged from beginning to end.


## **Breakdown in simple words**

### **1. Your opening line is everything**

The first sentence decides whether people will listen or get bored.
Your opening should **hook** the audience.

Good ways to start:

* A short emotional story
* A shocking or surprising statistic
* A new fact
* A quote
* A rhetorical question

**Why?** Because it creates curiosity and makes people pay attention immediately.


### **2. Tell the topic clearly at the beginning**

Right after the hook, clearly say what your talk is about.

If people don’t know what the talk is about within the first few seconds, you lose their interest.

Example:
“Last seven years have been the warmest on record.”
→ Hook (shocking fact)

Then:
“I’m here to talk about the dramatic changes in our climate and what we must do to stop them.”
→ Clear topic

### **3. Have a logical flow**

Once the audience understands the topic, structure your talk clearly.

### **4. Establish the need**

Explain:

* Why the current situation is a problem
* Why it needs to change
* What will happen if no action is taken
* How the problem affects the audience personally

Use 1–2 powerful statistics if relevant.

### **5. Present the solution**

Now that the audience understands the problem, explain:

* What can be done
* What options or steps exist
* What exactly you want them to do

This gives direction and purpose.

### **6. Paint the future**

Show two contrasting pictures:

**A. If they don’t act:**
What negative consequences will occur?

**B. If they do act:**
How life will get better, easier, safer, or more successful?

Use emotional but factual language.
If you have slides, use very simple images or diagrams.

### **7. End with clear action**

Finish your talk by telling the audience:

* The exact next steps
* What they should do immediately after the talk

A strong ending is as important as a strong opening.



Clishes are Boring
---

👉 When you use very common, predictable, overused lines, people lose interest because they’ve heard them many times before.


# **1. Using a cliché makes you sound less original**

If you say:

> “The grass is always greener on the other side.”

People think:

> “Oh, same old line.”

But if you create your own version, it sounds fresh.

Example given in the text:

> “The oranges always seem juicier on the other side of the orchard.”

Same meaning → but more creative, more original.


# **2. Avoid clichés to improve your vocabulary**

When you avoid clichés:

* You automatically start searching for better, new words
* Your brain becomes more creative
* You appear more intelligent
* Your speech sounds unique and memorable

This makes your audience feel you are an **original thinker**, not someone repeating old lines.

# **3. The exercise (2 parts)**

### **Part 1: Catch clichés**

* Notice when you are about to use a cliché
* Stop yourself
* Think of a fresh phrase instead
* Also notice clichés others use, but **don’t point them out**

### **Part 2: Create your own versions**

Try making your own twist on common clichés.

Example:
“Between the devil and the deep blue sea” →
The author’s version:

> “Between hunger and thirst.”

Same meaning → stuck between two difficult choices
But it sounds new and grabs attention.


Tell, tell and tell again!
---

# **The Three Key Rules of Public Speaking**

> “Tell your audience what you are going to tell them.
> Tell them.
> Tell them what you told them.”

This is the **classic structure for effective presentations**.


# **1. Beginning – Tell them what you are going to tell them**

* At the **start of your talk**, clearly outline the points you will cover.
* This helps the audience know **what to expect**.
* Avoid starting your talk blindly; don’t make the audience figure out the purpose themselves — they might lose interest immediately.

**Example (animal welfare internship):**

> “I want to explain how my internship at the veterinary clinic will help me on the job. I will give you three examples of how I expect to use what I learned.”

- Audience now knows:

* Purpose of the talk
* Number of points to expect
* Why they should pay attention


# **2. Middle – Tell them**

* This is the **body of your talk**, where you expand on the points you promised.
* Mention your summary sentences as you cover each point, to **reinforce the key ideas**.

**Example:**

> “I learned how to dress an injured animal, which would allow me to handle emergency situations if the vet is unavailable.”

* Here, you are **explaining and connecting your experience to your purpose**.
* Reinforcing the summary sentences keeps your audience focused.


# **3. End – Tell them what you told them**

* At the **conclusion**, summarize the main points again in a slightly different way.
* This ensures the audience leaves with the **purpose of your talk clearly in mind**.

**Example:**

> “As you can see, the internship was extremely helpful. The three examples I’ve discussed show how I intend to make use of the internship for my career growth.”

* Rephrasing the summary cements the message.
* The audience now **remembers the key takeaway**.


# **Why this works**

* Keeps the audience engaged
* Makes your talk structured and easy to follow
* Ensures your purpose is clear
* Reinforces your main message multiple times without being boring


# **Simple Formula**

1. **Intro:** “Here’s what I’m going to tell you”
2. **Body:** “Here’s what I learned / Here’s what I want to share”
3. **Conclusion:** “So here’s what I told you / Here’s why it matters”

**Example**

Sure! Let’s **explain the “Tell them what you are going to tell them → Tell them → Tell them what you told them” structure** using a real example: **“Why private school is better than government school.”**

# **1. Beginning – Tell them what you are going to tell them**

At the start, clearly outline the points your talk will cover so your audience knows what to expect.

**Example introduction:**

> “Today, I want to explain why private schools can offer better education than government schools. I will give you three reasons: smaller class sizes, better infrastructure, and more extracurricular opportunities.”

✅ Audience now knows:

* The topic: Why private schools are better
* The number of points: 3 reasons
* Why they should listen


# **2. Middle – Tell them**

Now, expand on each point clearly, reinforcing the key idea.

**Example body:**

1. **Smaller class sizes:**

> “Private schools usually have fewer students per classroom. This allows teachers to give more individual attention, helping students understand concepts better.”

2. **Better infrastructure:**

> “Private schools often have modern labs, libraries, and digital classrooms. This makes learning more engaging and effective compared to overcrowded government schools.”

3. **Extracurricular opportunities:**

> “Private schools provide sports, music, and clubs that help develop a child’s talents and confidence, giving them a well-rounded education.”

Here, you are **explaining your points and connecting them to your main topic**. Repeating your summary phrases keeps the audience focused.


# **3. End – Tell them what you told them**

Summarize the main points in slightly different words to leave a lasting impression.

**Example conclusion:**

> “So, as you can see, private schools provide smaller class sizes, better infrastructure, and more extracurricular activities. These factors together make private schools a more effective environment for learning and overall development compared to government schools.”

✅ Now the audience clearly remembers:

* Your topic
* The main points
* The takeaway message


# **Summary of the Structure With This Example**

1. **Intro:** “Here’s what I’m going to tell you” → 3 reasons why private schools are better
2. **Body:** “Here’s what I found” → Explain each reason with examples
3. **Conclusion:** “Here’s what I told you” → Reiterate the 3 reasons.

Speak with your Eyes
---


# **Why Eye Contact is Important**

* In **everyday conversation**, we naturally look at the person we are talking to.
* In **public speaking**, this is even more important because it **keeps your audience engaged**.
* If you stare at the wall, ceiling, or a blank space, your speech loses energy and connection.

**Key idea:** Eye contact makes your audience **feel included and involved** in your talk.


# **How to Start With Eye Contact**

1. **Find someone familiar:**

   * If you know someone in the audience, start by talking to them.
   * This eases nervousness and makes the speech feel less intimidating.

2. **If you don’t know anyone:**

   * Pretend you are talking to a friend one-on-one.
   * This turns a public speech into a personal conversation, which is easier to handle.

3. **Hold your gaze:**

   * Lock eyes with one person for **10–15 seconds** (roughly one complete thought).
   * Don’t just glance and move on — the audience feels more connected when you focus on them for a moment.


# **Practical Example (Using the Veterinary Clinic Speech)**

* Thought 1:

> “I interned at the veterinary clinic for a month, and the experience was enriching.”
> **Lock eyes with one person for this thought.**

* Thought 2:

> “I learned valuable skills that I can use in my future job.”
> **Switch to another person and maintain eye contact for this thought.**

❌ What **not to do**: Rapidly switch eyes multiple times in a single sentence.

* It **reduces impact** and makes your speech seem disconnected.


# **Tips to Reduce Nervousness**

* Take a deep breath before starting.
* Relax — you don’t have to be overly serious.
* Some suggest imagining the audience in funny ways (like wearing underwear) to ease nerves — but this is optional.
* Confidence in your **preparation and content** is usually enough.


# **Key Takeaways**

1. Eye contact = engagement + connection.
2. Start with someone familiar or pretend one-on-one conversation.
3. Hold gaze for 10–15 seconds per thought.
4. Avoid rapid shifting of eyes — it loses impact.
5. Relax and breathe; confidence in content helps more than gimmicks.


Get confidence in your voice
---

# **Explanation (in very simple words)**

This passage teaches one big lesson:

**Your voice becomes powerful ONLY when you are well-prepared and confident — not because of its natural texture.**

Let’s break it down.


# **1. Why we don’t sound good when we are nervous**

When we feel nervous:

* Our voice shakes
* We sound weak
* We sound unsure
* Even good speakers sound bad

Why?
Because **voice never lies**. It immediately shows your stress.


# **2. Why do we get nervous?**

Because:

* We fear public speaking (stage fright)
* We worry about mistakes
* We doubt our preparation

When fear increases → confidence drops → voice trembles → delivery becomes poor.

So the real problem is not the voice.
The real problem is **lack of preparation**.


# **3. Strong voice ≠ born voice**

A powerful voice does NOT come from:

* Deep tone
* Sexy voice
* Heavy bass

It comes from:

* Preparation
* Good content
* Practice
* Confidence

Even a soft voice sounds confident when the speaker is well prepared.


# **4. How to Build a Confident Voice**

### ✔ Step 1 — Prepare your content

* Research properly
* Structure your material
* Add examples/stories
* Avoid too much information

### ✔ Step 2 — Practice like a professional

Record yourself on:

* Phone camera
* Laptop camera
* Tablet

Watch the recording:

* Check your tone
* Check your body posture
* Check confidence
* Make corrections
* Practice again and again

This repeated practice gives **ultimate confidence** when you speak on stage.


# **5. Example of powerful vs weak delivery**

Two versions of same line:

### **Good delivery**

Energetic, controlled, confident.

### **Bad delivery**

Flat, weak, shaky.

The words were same, but delivery changed everything.

This shows:
👉 **Delivery matters more than content alone.**

# **6. Don’t force your voice to sound “deeper” or “cooler”**

Many people try:

* To talk in a deeper voice
* To speak slowly to sound serious
* To change their natural tone

This creates problems:

* You sound fake
* You sound monotonous
* You lose natural intonation
* You become too conscious
* Your speech becomes robotic

The speaker gives an example:
When they try to make their voice deeper, they sound weird and flat.
So they stop doing it.

👉 **You are not a voice-over artist. Don’t ruin your natural voice.**
