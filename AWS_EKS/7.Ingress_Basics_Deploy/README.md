**1. Ingress Annotations** - It is Load Balance Settings which we are going to provisions

**2. Ingress class name** - For define which this Ingress service need to be associated to or belongs to.

If you already created `ingress class` is set to `true` - So we don't need to define Ingress Class name in ingress service.

- Here, All annotations is provided for Load Balancer Settings.
