# **Improved & Clear Explanation for Better English Communication**

When we communicate, our **first and most important goal** is to build a relationship with the other person.
If we fail to create a relaxed and comfortable connection, the rest of the conversation becomes harder.

So, in any conversation, our first task is to build **rapport**.


## **What is Rapport?**

- Rappo0rt is the feeling that the other person is “like us” — that we connect with them and feel comfortable.
- It happens when there is **similarity in communication style**.
Rapport is basically a pattern-matching process.

Interestingly, **most rapport-building happens without words**.

We build rapport through:

* Body orientation
* How we move
* Eye contact
* Facial expressions
* Tone of voice

Humans do this naturally — it’s instinctive.
However, stress, workplace pressure, or emotional tension can weaken these natural patterns.
A little **conscious effort** at the start of a conversation can greatly improve how it goes.

## **How We Build Rapport**

We build rapport through three kinds of behavior:

1. **Verbal behavior** – the words we use
2. **Vocal behavior** – tone, pitch, pace, volume
3. **Physical behavior** – body language, posture, expression

### **1. Verbal Behavior (Words)**

Words do matter.
For example:

* ❌ “That is sad.”
* ✅ “Oh, it’s disheartening to hear that. I’m sure it must be stressful for you.”

Both convey sympathy, but the second one shows **deeper empathy**.

### **2. Physical Behavior (Body Language)**

If words and body language do not match, people believe the **body**, not the words.

Example:

* If you greet someone with no smile and a cold expression but say,
  “It’s such a pleasure to see you,”
  they will believe your **face**, not your words.

So, to build rapport, show physical signs of being:

* Welcoming
* Relaxed
* Open

### **3. Vocal Behavior (Tone of Voice)**

Tone changes meaning.

Compare:

* “I’m really glad to see you.” (warm)
* “I’m really glad to see you.” (flat or irritated tone)

Pitch, pace, and volume matter:

* **Fast, loud, high-pitched →** you sound tense or nervous
* **Slow, soft, lower-pitched →** you sound calm and friendly

A warm tone builds rapport faster.

## **Small Talk Helps Build Rapport**

Starting a conversation with someone new can feel stressful or awkward.
“Breaking the ice” is a skill, and the key is to **reduce tension**.

How to start?

* Talk about something you both share in the moment
* Make a simple, friendly comment
* Ask a question that doesn’t feel personal or intrusive

Avoid:

* Talking too much about yourself
* Asking direct personal questions
  Both can increase tension.

Instead, make them feel comfortable.
When they relax, **you** will relax too.

Example at a networking event:

> “The event management seems really good this time, doesn’t it?”

This simple comment opens the door to a conversation.
What happens next depends on how you continue with engaging statements and supportive responses.

# **In Summary**

To improve communication and build rapport:

1. Match body language and tone naturally
2. Use empathetic and thoughtful words
3. Keep your tone warm and calm
4. Start conversations with simple, shared-situation comments
5. Focus on making the other person comfortable

When rapport is established early, conversations become smoother, easier, and more meaningful.
